abstract = {The {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m-sized probe of the scanning transmission electron microscope can visualize and collect spectra from single atoms. This can unambiguously resolve the chemical structure of materials, but not their isotopic composition. Here we differentiate between two isotopes of the same element by quantifying how likely the energetic imaging electrons are to eject atoms. First, we measure the displacement probability in graphene grown from either 12C or 13C and describe the process using a quantum mechanical model of lattice vibrations coupled with density functional theory simulations. We then test our spatial resolution in a mixed sample by ejecting individual atoms from nanoscale areas spanning an interface region that is far from atomically sharp, mapping the isotope concentration with a precision better than 20\%. Although we use a scanning instrument, our method may be applicable to any atomic resolution transmission electron microscope and to other low-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {The atomic structure of nanomaterials is often studied using transmission electron microscopy. In addition to image formation, the energetic electrons impinging on the sample may also cause damage. In a good conductor such as graphene, the damage is limited to the knock-on process caused by elastic electron-nucleus scattering. This process is determined by the kinetic energy an atom needs to be sputtered, i.e. its displacement threshold energy Ed. This is typically assumed to have a fixed value for all electron impacts on equivalent atoms within a crystal. Here we show using density functional tight-binding simulations that the displacement threshold energy is affected by thermal perturbations of atoms from their equilibrium positions. This effect can be accounted for in the estimation of the displacement cross section by replacing the constant threshold energy value with a distribution. Our refined model better describes previous precision measurements of graphene knock-on damage, and should be considered also for other low-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {CdTe quantum dots have unique characteristics that are promising for applications in photoluminescence, photovoltaics or optoelectronics. However, wide variations of the reported quantum yields exist and the influence of ligand-surface interactions that are expected to control the excited state relaxation processes remains unknown. It is important to thoroughly understand the fundamental principles underlying these relaxation processes to tailor the QDs properties to their application. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of the surface atoms, ligand functional groups and solvent on the radiative and non-radiative relaxation rates. Combining a systematic synthetic approach with X-ray photoelectron, quantitative FT-IR and time-resolved visible spectroscopies, we find that CdTe QDs can be engineered with average radiative lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds up to microseconds. The non-radiative lifetimes are anticorrelated to the radiative lifetimes, although they show much less variation. The density, nature and orientation of the ligand functional groups and the dielectric constant of the solvent play major roles in determining charge carrier trapping and excitonic relaxation pathways. These results are used to propose a coupled dependence between hole-trapping on Te atoms and strong ligand coupling, primarily via Cd atoms, that can be used to engineer both the radiative and non-radiative lifetimes.},

@article{Beattie1959,
abstract = {This paper presents a calculation of the lifetimes ($\tau$) of excess electrons and holes in a semiconductor aaanming the Auger effect between bands (electron-electron and hole-hole collisions) to be the only recombination mechanism. If pair annihilation, and the corresponding reverse process of pair creation, are counted separately, there are four classes of processes to be considered. The suitably weighted algebraic sum of the rates of these processes yields a net recombination rate R. If N be the non-equilibrium number of pairs, then $\tau$ = N/R . In the calculation the effect of traps is neglected, and the group of electrons in the conduction band and the group in the valence band are each assumed to be in equilibrium among themselves, but not with each other, by the use of quasi-Fermi levels. Bloch functions $\psi$k = u(k, r) exp (ik.r) are used. The matrix element of the Coulomb interaction is obtained as a multiple sum over reciprocal lattice vectors. Most of these terms correspond to Umklapp-type processes whose probability of occurrence is shown to be small. The dominant term, after integration over all initial and final states, yields the dependence of lifetime on temperature, carrier concentration, energy gap and other parameters. The absolute value of the lifetime depends also on an overlap intergral of the form Su*(k, r) u(k', r) dr where k, k' are in different bands. This integral is estimated on the basis of a one-dimensional model. The theory is compared with experimental lifetimes in InSb, and shows that the mechanism envisaged may dominate radiative recombination above 240 °K and accounts for the order of magnitude of the observed lifetimes ($\sim$ 10-8 s) in the neighbourhood of the highest temperature (330 °K) at which recombination in InSb has so far been studied.},

abstract = {Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) images with resolutions of the order of an {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m can be obtained using modern microscopes corrected for chromatic aberration. However, the delocalized nature of the transition potentials for atomic ionization often confounds direct interpretation of EFTEM images, leading to what is known as “preservation of elastic contrast”. In this paper we demonstrate how more interpretable images might be obtained by scanning with a focused coherent probe and incoherently averaging the energy-filtered images over probe position. We dub this new imaging technique energy-filtered imaging scanning transmission electron microscopy (EFISTEM). We develop a theoretical framework for EFISTEM and show that it is in fact equivalent to precession EFTEM, where the plane wave illumination is precessed through a range of tilts spanning the same range of angles as the probe forming aperture in EFISTEM. It is demonstrated that EFISTEM delivers similar results to scanning transmission electron microscopy with an electron energy-loss spectrometer but has the advantage that it is immune to coherent aberrations and spatial incoherence of the probe and is also more resilient to scan distortions.},

Depending on these phases, one deals with coherent states in (3 + 1) D, vortex particles with orbital angular momentum, the Airy beams, and their generalizations. A method is developed in which a number of events represents a functional of the Wigner functions of such states. Using width of a packet $\sigma$p/〈p〉 as a small parameter, the Wigner functions, the number of events, and a cross section are represented as power series in this parameter, the first non-vanishing corrections to their plane-wave expressions are derived, and generalizations for beams are made. Although in this regime the Wigner functions turn out to be everywhere positive, the cross section develops new specifically quantum features, inaccessible in the plane-wave approximation. Among them is dependence on an impact parameter between the beams, on phases of the incoming states, and on a phase of the scattering amplitude. A model-independent analysis of these effects is made. Two ways of measuring how a Coulomb phase and a hadronic one change with a transferred momentum t are discussed.},

Such quantum states of photons, electrons and neutrons have been generated experimentally in recent years, opening up new perspectives in quantum optics, electron microscopy, particle physics, and so forth. Here we discuss the non-plane-wave effects in scattering brought about by the novel quantum numbers of these wave packets. For the well-focused electrons of intermediate energies, already available at electron microscopes, the corresponding contribution can surpass that of the radiative corrections. Moreover, collisions of the cat-like superpositions of such focused beams with atoms allow one to probe effects of the quantum interference, which have never played any role in particle scattering.},

abstract = {Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides consist of monolayers held together by weak forces where the layers are electronically and vibrationally coupled. Isolated monolayers show changes in electronic structure and lattice vibration energies, including a transition from indirect to direct bandgap. Here we present a new member of the family, rhenium disulphide (ReS2), where such variation is absent and bulk behaves as electronically and vibrationally decoupled monolayers stacked together. From bulk to monolayers, ReS2 remains direct bandgap and its Raman spectrum shows no dependence on the number of layers. Interlayer decoupling is further demonstrated by the insensitivity of the optical absorption and Raman spectrum to interlayer distance modulated by hydrostatic pressure. Theoretical calculations attribute the decoupling to Peierls distortion of the 1T structure of ReS2, which prevents ordered stacking and minimizes the interlayer overlap of wavefunctions. Such vanishing interlayer coupling enables probing of two-dimensional-like systems without the need for monolayers.},

Well-sintered bodies were obtained only by the BaZrO3−CS2 reaction. The time dependence of grain growth was affected considerably when reaction and sintering occurred above 1250° C. Non-uniform grain growth which occurs when an excess of Ba is present can be interpreted in terms of secondary recrystallization resulting from segregation of BaS at the grain boundary during sintering.

abstract = {Our understanding of defects in materials science has changed tremendously over the last century. While 100 years ago they were often ignored by scientists, nowadays they are in the spotlight of scientific interest and whole branches of technology have emerged from their skillful handling. The first part of this article gives a historical overview and discusses why defects are so important for modern material science. In the second part, we review the treatment of defects in semiconductors. We start by explaining the assumptions and approximations involved in ab-initio calculations and then discuss the treatment of defects in semiconductors. In the third part, we focus on defects in metals. We discuss the theoretical treatment of vacancies starting from experimental findings. The impact of improved theoretical techniques on the predictive power is discussed. This is illustrated with the role of vacancies in intermetallic compounds and random alloys. The last section deals with dislocations.},

Bandgap engineering was implemented by chemical substitution in the form of CH3NH3SnI3–xBrx solid solutions, which can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free solar cells with an initial power conversion efficiency of 5.73\% under simulated full sunlight. Further efficiency enhancements are expected following optimization and a better fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering. The reported CH3NH3SnI3–xBrx perovskite solar cells represent a step towards the realization of low-cost, environmentally friendly solid-state solar cells.},

abstract = {The evolution of real-time medical diagnostic tools such as angiography and computer tomography from radiography based on photographic plates was enabled by the development of integrated solid-state X-ray photon detectors made from conventional solid-state semiconductors. Recently, for optoelectronic devices operating in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, solution-processed organic and inorganic semiconductors have also attracted a great deal of attention. Here, we demonstrate a possibility to use such inexpensive semiconductors for the sensitive detection of X-ray photons by direct photon-to-current conversion. In particular, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) offers a compelling combination of fast photoresponse and a high absorption cross-section for X-rays, owing to the heavy Pb and I atoms. Solution-processed photodiodes as well as photoconductors are presented, exhibiting high values of X-ray sensitivity (up to 25 $\mu$C mGyair−1 cm−3) and responsivity (1.9 × 104 carriers/photon), which are commensurate with those obtained by the current solid-state technology.},

abstract = {Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3–4\%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10\%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18\% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20\% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.},

abstract = {Abstract The last eight years (2009–2017) have seen an explosive growth of interest in organic–inorganic halide perovskites in the research communities of photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. In addition, recent advancements have demonstrated that this type of perovskite has a great potential in the technology of light-signal detection with a comparable performance to commercially available crystalline Si and III–V photodetectors. The contemporary growth of state-of-the-art multifunctional perovskites in the field of light-signal detection has benefited from its outstanding intrinsic optoelectronic properties, including photoinduced polarization, high drift mobilities, and effective charge collection, which are excellent for this application. Photoactive perovskite semiconductors combine effective light absorption, allowing detection of a wide range of electromagnetic waves from ultraviolet and visible, to the near-infrared region, with low-cost solution processability and good photon yield. This class of semiconductor might empower breakthrough photodetector technology in the field of imaging, optical communications, and biomedical sensing. Therefore, here, the focus is specifically on the critical understanding of materials synthesis, design, and engineering for the next-stage development of perovskite photodetectors and highlighting the current challenges in the field, which need to be further studied in the future.},

abstract = {The effects of depositing ultrathin (<1 nm) Al2O3 coatings on LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) particles using atomic layer deposition (ALD) are presented. Promising electrochemical performance of the Al2O3 ALD coated LNMO at 30 °C is demonstrated in not only significantly improved coulombic efficiency, cycle retention, and rate capability, but also in dramatically suppressed self-discharge and dissolution of transition metals. Combined analyses by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex-situ time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry reveal that the solid electrolyte interphase layer on the Al2O3 ALD coated LNMO is much thinner and contains fewer organic species than the one on the bare LNMO. This difference originates from the suppression of the side reaction at high voltage by the Al2O3 ALD protective coating. Also, fluorination of Al2O3 ALD layer upon repeated charge–discharge cycling is confirmed, and this can account for the capacity increases during the initial charge–discharge cycles. Finally, it is also demonstrated that a full LNMO/Li4Ti5O12 battery incorporating the Al2O3 ALD coated LNMO outperforms the one incorporating only bare LNMO.},

abstract = {LiCoO2 in the commercial lithium ion batteries has been suffering from its poor cycling performance at high cutoff voltages. In this study, we employ an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to surface-modify a LiCoO2 material with various thickness-controlled metal oxide (TiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3) coatings to improve its battery performance. The effects of the metal oxide coatings on the electrochemical performance of LiCoO2 electrode are studied in detail. It is demonstrated that a uniform and dense coating via the ALD route on LiCoO2 powder can lower the battery performance due to an obvious decrease in lithium diffusion and electron transport with the coating layers. In contrast, it is revealed that a direct coating on prefabricated LiCoO2 electrodes performs much better than a coating on LiCoO2 powders. It is further disclosed that the improved electrochemical performance of coated LiCoO2 electrode is highly dependent on the coating materials. Of the three coating materials, the Al2O3 coating results in the best cycling stability while the ZrO2 coating contributes to the best rate capability. It is thus suggested that the coating materials are functionally specific, and for the best improvement of a cathode, a particular coating material should be sought.},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials are at the heart of many novel devices due to their unique and often superior properties. For simplicity, 2D materials are often assumed to exist in their text-book form, i.e., as an ideal solid with no imperfections. However, defects are ubiquitous in macroscopic samples and play an important - if not imperative - role for the performance of any device. Thus, many independent studies have targeted the artificial introduction of defects into 2D materials by particle irradiation. In our view it would be beneficial to develop general defect engineering strategies for 2D materials based on a thorough understanding of the defect creation mechanisms, which may significantly vary from the ones relevant for 3D materials. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in defect engineering of 2D materials by electron and ion irradiation with a clear focus on defect creation on the atomic scale and by individual impacts. Whenever possible we compile reported experimental data alongside corresponding theoretical studies. We show that, on the one hand, defect engineering by particle irradiation covers a wide range of defect types that can be fabricated with great precision in the most commonly investigated 2D materials. On the other hand, gaining a complete understanding still remains a challenge, that can be met by combining advanced theoretical methods and improved experimental set-ups, both of which only now begin to emerge. In conjunction with novel 2D materials, this challenge promises attractive future opportunities for researchers in this field.},

However, energy transferred from the e-beam can also provide a way to modify 2D materials via defect engineering when the interaction of the beam with the sample is precisely controlled. In this article, we discuss the atomic geometry, formation mechanism, and properties of several types of structural defects, ranging from zero-dimensional point defects to extended domains, induced by an e-beam in a few representative 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, transition-metal dichalcogenides, and phosphorene. We show that atomic as well as line defects and even novel nanostructures can be created and manipulated in 2D materials by an e-beam in a controllable manner. Phase transitions can also be induced. The e-beam in a (scanning) transmission electron microscope not only resolves the intrinsic atomic structure of materials with defects, but also provides new opportunities to modify the structure with subnanometer precision.},

abstract = {The catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the anion vacancy of 40 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is investigated using the hydrogen adsorption free energy ($\Delta$GH) as the activity descriptor. While vacancy-free basal planes are mostly inactive, anion vacancy makes the hydrogen bonding stronger than clean basal planes, promoting the HER performance of many TMDs. We find that ZrSe2 and ZrTe2 have similar $\Delta$GH as Pt, the best HER catalyst, at low vacancy density. $\Delta$GH depends significantly on the vacancy density, which could be exploited as a tuning parameter. At proper vacancy densities, MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, ReSe2, ReTe2, WSe2, IrTe2, and HfTe2 are expected to show the optimal HER activity. The detailed analysis of electronic structure and the multiple linear regression results identifies the vacancy formation energy and band-edge positions as key parameters correlating with $\Delta$GH at anion vacancy of TMDs.},

Activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein, we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane, where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy ($\Delta$GH) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies, which fine-tunes the catalytic activity. Proper combinations of S-vacancy and strain yield the optimal $\Delta$GH = 0 eV, which allows us to achieve the highest intrinsic HER activity among molybdenum-sulphide-based catalysts.},

First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT+U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials.},

The data is then quantified, allowing insight into the defect formation mechanism, which is discussed in comparison with the potential candidate damage processes. We show that the defect shapes are determined by an interplay between electron damage, which we assign to charging, and thermal effects.

Here, the free exciton transition (FX) in h-BN bulk crystals synthesized by a solution method at atmospheric pressure has been probed by deep UV time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Based on the separations between the energy peak positions of the FX emission lines, the identical PL decay kinetics among different FX emission lines, and the known phonon modes in h-BN, we suggest that there is only one principal emission line corresponding to the direct intrinsic FX transition in h-BN, whereas all other fine features are a result of phonon-assisted transitions. The identified phonon modes are all associated with the center of the Brillouin zone. Our results offer a simple picture for the understanding of the fundamental exciton transitions in h-BN.},

The damage cross–sections were determined by direct counting of atoms in the AC–HRTEM images. The contributions of damage mechanisms such as knock–on damage or ionization effects were estimated by comparing the damage rates in different heterostructure configurations, similarly to what has been earlier done with MoS2. The behaviour of MoSe2 was found to be nearly identical to that of MoS2, which is an unexpected result, as the knock-on mechanism should be suppressed in MoSe2 due to the high mass of Se, as compared to S.},

abstract = {The formal relationship between ultrasoft 共US兲 Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials and Blo¨chl's projector augmented wave 共PAW兲 method is derived. It is shown that the total energy functional for US pseudopotentials can be obtained by linearization of two terms in a slightly modified PAW total energy functional. The Hamil- ton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudo- potential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (H2,H2O, Li2,N2,F2,BF3 , SiF4) and several bulk systems 共diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF$_2$, Fe, Co, Ni兲.

abstract = {The hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits a complex structural behaviour, with successive transitions between orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic polymorphs at ca. 165 K and 327 K. Herein we report first-principles lattice dynamics (phonon spectrum) for each phase of CH3NH3PbI3. The equilibrium structures compare well to solutions of temperature-dependent powder neutron diffraction. By following the normal modes we calculate infrared and Raman intensities of the vibrations, and compare them to the measurement of a single crystal where the Raman laser is controlled to avoid degradation of the sample. Despite a clear separation in energy between low frequency modes associated with the inorganic PbI3 network and high-frequency modes of the organic CH3NH3+ cation, significant coupling between them is found, which emphasises the interplay between molecular orientation and the corner-sharing octahedral networks in the structural transformations. Soft modes are found at the boundary of the Brillouin zone of the cubic phase, consistent with displacive instabilities and anharmonicity involving tilting of the PbI6 octahedra around room temperature.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. We report experiments and calculations investigating the pressure and temperature dependences of the optical phonons in BaZrS3, and the pressure dependence of its absorption edge. BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite in a novel class of materials being considered for photovoltaics. It is studied by Raman spectroscopy as functions of temperature (at 1 atm) and pressure (at 120 and 295 K), and by pressure-transmission spectroscopy at 295 K. Density-functional-theory calculations predict the allowed Raman lines, their intensities, their pressure shifts, and the band-gap pressure shift. Cooling shifts all but one of the phonon peaks to higher frequencies; the temperature coefficients are typical of semiconductors. A strong low-temperature peak at 392.3 cm-1 is attributed to resonant forbidden LO scattering; its shift with temperature has the opposite sign. The pressure coefficients of the phonon frequencies for all observed Raman peaks are positive, indicating no mode softening. The rates of pressure shift also are typical, and show the customary scaling with phonon frequency. Experiment and theory show good agreement on the pressure-induced frequency shifts. The BaZrS3 absorption edge moves to lower energy with pressure, reflecting a reduction of the band gap. The measured shift is ∼-0.015 eV/GPa, slightly less than the density-functional-theory result of -0.025 eV/GPa. We find no evidence that the perovskite structure of BaZ rS3 undergoes any phase changes under hydrostatic pressure to at least 8.9 GPa. Our results indicate the robust structural stability of BaZrS3, and suggest cation alloying as a viable approach for band-gap engineering for photovoltaic and other applications.},

abstract = {Monolayer tungsten disulfides (WS2) constitute a high quantum yield two-dimensional (2D) system, and can be synthesized on a large area using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), suggesting promising nanophotonics applications. However, spatially nonuniform photoluminescence (PL) intensities and peak wavelengths observed in single WS2 grains have puzzled researchers, with the origins of variation in relative contributions of excitons, trions, and biexcitons to the PL emission not well understood. Here, we present nanoscale PL and Raman spectroscopy images of triangular CVD-grown WS2 monolayers of different sizes, with these images obtained under different temperatures and values of excitation power. Intense PL emissions were observed around the edges of individual WS2 grains and the grain boundaries between partly merged WS2 grains. The predominant origin of the main PL emission from these regions changed from neutral excitons to trions and biexcitons with increasing laser excitation power, with biexcitons completely dominating the PL emission for the high-power condition. The intense PL emission and the preferential formation of biexcitons in the edges and grain boundaries of monolayer WS2 were attributed to larger population of charge carriers caused by the excessive incorporation of growth promoters during the CVD, suggesting positive roles of excessive carriers in the PL efficiency of TMD monolayers. Our comprehensive nanoscale spectroscopic investigation sheds light on the dynamic competition between exciton complexes occurring in monolayer WS2, suggesting a rich variety of ways to engineer new nanophotonic functions using 2D transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) differs fundamentally from other group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to its low structural symmetry, which results in its optical and electrical anisotropy. Although vertical growth is observed in some TMDs under special growth conditions, vertical growth in ReS 2 is very different in that it is highly spontaneous and substrate-independent. In this study, the mechanism that underpins the thermodynamically favorable vertical growth mode of ReS 2 is uncovered. It is found that the governing mechanism for ReS 2 growth involves two distinct stages. In the first stage, ReS 2 grows parallel to the growth substrate, consistent with conventional TMD growth. However, subsequent vertical growth is nucleated at points on the lattice where Re atoms are "pinched" together. At such sites, an additional Re atom binds with the cluster of pinched Re atoms, leaving an under-coordinated S atom protruding out of the ReS 2 plane. This under-coordinated S is "reactive" and binds to free Re and S atoms, initiating growth in a direction perpendicular to the ReS 2 surface. The utility of such vertical ReS 2 arrays in applications where high surface-to-volume ratio and electric-field enhancement are essential, such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, field emission, and solar-based disinfection of bacteria, is demonstrated.},

abstract = {The structural, dynamical, and thermodynamic properties of diamond, graphite and layered derivatives (graphene, rhombohedral graphite) are computed using a combination of density-functional theory total-energy calculations and density-functional perturbation theory lattice dynamics in the generalized gradient approximation. Overall, very good agreement is found for the structural properties and phonon dispersions, with the exception of the c∕a ratio in graphite and the associated elastic constants and phonon dispersions. Both the C33 elastic constant and the $\Gamma$ to A phonon dispersions are brought to close agreement with available data once the experimental c∕a is chosen for the calculations. The vibrational free energy and the thermal expansion, the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli and the specific heat are calculated using the quasiharmonic approximation. Graphite shows a distinctive in-plane negative thermal-expansion coefficient that reaches its lowest value around room temperature, in very good agreement with experiments. Thermal contraction in graphene is found to be three times as large; in both cases, bending acoustic modes are shown to be responsible for the contraction, in a direct manifestation of the membrane effect predicted by Lifshitz over 50 years ago. Stacking directly affects the bending modes, explaining the large numerical difference between the thermal-contraction coefficients in graphite and graphene, notwithstanding their common physical origin.},

abstract = {Layered semiconductors based on transition-metal chalcogenides usually cross from indirect bandgap in the bulk limit over to direct bandgap in the quantum (2D) limit. Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe(2), which shows stark contrast from the well-explored MoS(2) where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe(2) is much enhanced with the temperature rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors. The direct bandgap of MoSe(2), identified at 1.55 eV, may also promise applications in energy conversion involving solar spectrum, as it is close to the optimal bandgap value of single-junction solar cells and photoelechemical devices.},

Here we report Raman spectra of atomically thin sheets of WS2 and WSe2, isoelectronic compounds of MoS2, in the mono- to few-layer thickness regime. We show that, similar to the case of MoS2, the characteristic A1g and E2g(1) modes exhibit stiffening and softening with increasing number of layers, respectively, with a small shift of less than 3 cm(-1) due to large mass of the atoms. Thickness dependence is also observed in a series of multiphonon bands arising from overtone, combination, and zone edge phonons, whose intensity exhibit significant enhancement in excitonic resonance conditions. Some of these multiphonon peaks are found to be absent only in monolayers. These features provide a unique fingerprint and rapid identification for monolayer flakes.},

abstract = {The Raman scattering of single- and few-layered WS2 is studied as a function of the number of S-W-S layers and the excitation wavelength in the visible range (488, 514 and 647 nm). For the three excitation wavelengths used in this study, the frequency of the A(1g)($\Gamma$) phonon mode monotonically decreases with the number of layers. For single-layer WS2, the 514.5 nm laser excitation generates a second-order Raman resonance involving the longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)). This resonance results from a coupling between the electronic band structure and lattice vibrations. First-principles calculations were used to determine the electronic and phonon band structures of single-layer and bulk WS2. The reduced intensity of the 2LA mode was then computed, as a function of the laser wavelength, from the fourth-order Fermi golden rule. Our observations establish an unambiguous and nondestructive Raman fingerprint for identifying single- and few-layered WS2 films.},

abstract = {The problem of electron-beam damage in the transmission electron microscope is reviewed, with an emphasis on radiolysis processes in soft materials and organic specimens. Factors that determine the dose-limited resolution are identified for three different operational modes: bright-field scattering- contrast, phase-contrast and dark-field microscopy. Methods of reducing radiation damage are discussed, including low-dose techniques, cooling or encapsulating the specimen, and the choice of imaging mode, incident-beam diameter and incident-electron energy. Further experiments are suggested as a means of obtaining a better understanding and control of electron-beam damage.},

In systems where the force along the minimum energy path is large compared to the restoring force perpendicular to the path and when many images of the system are included in the elastic band, kinks can develop and prevent the band from converging to the minimum energy path. We show how the kinks arise and present an improved way of estimating the local tangent which solves the problem. The task of finding an accurate energy and configuration for the saddle point is also discussed and examples given where a complementary method, the dimer method, is used to efficiently converge to the saddle point. Both methods only require the first derivative of the energy and can, therefore, easily be applied in plane wave based density-functional theory calculations. Examples are given from studies of the exchange diffusion mechanism in a Si crystal, Al addimer formation on the Al(100) surface, and dissociative adsorption of CH 4 on an Ir(111) surface.},

abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ‘‘metric'' and a special ‘‘preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We report how the presence of electron- beam-induced sulfur vacancies affects first-order Raman modes and correlate the effects with the evolution of the in situ transmission-electron microscopy two-terminal con- ductivity of monolayer MoS2 under electron irradiation. We observe a red-shift in the E′ Raman peak and a less pronounced blue-shift in the A′1 peak with increasing electron dose. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and selected-area electron diffraction, we show that irradiation causes partial removal of sulfur and correlate the dependence of the Raman peak shifts with S vacancy density (a few \%). This allows us to quantitatively correlate the frequency shifts with vacancy concentration, as rationalized by first-principles density functional theory calculations. In situ device current measurements show an exponential decrease in channel current upon irradiation. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed frequency shifts are intrinsic properties of the defective systems and that Raman spectroscopy can be used as a quantitative diagnostic tool to characterize MoS2-based transport channels.},

abstract = {It is well established that defects strongly influence properties in two-dimensional materials. For graphene, atomic defects activate the Raman-active centrosymmetric A1g ring-breathing mode known as the D-peak. The relative intensity of this D-peak compared to the G-band peak is the most widely accepted measure of the quality of graphene films. However, no such metric exists for monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS2 or MoS2. Here we intentionally create atomic-scale defects in the hexagonal lattice of pristine WS2 and MoS2 monolayers using plasma treatments and study the evolution of their Raman and photoluminescence spectra. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms plasma-induced creation of atomic-scale point defects in the monolayer sheets. We find that while the Raman spectra of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (at 532 nm excitation) are insensitive to defects, their photoluminescence reveals a distinct defect-related spectral feature located ∼0.1 eV below the neutral free A-exciton peak. This peak originates from defect-bound neutral excitons and intensifies as the two-dimensional (2D) sheet is made more defective. This spectral feature is observable in air under ambient conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), which allows for a relatively simple way to determine the defectiveness of 2D semiconducting nanosheets. Controlled defect creation could also enable tailoring of the optical properties of these materials in optoelectronic device applications.},

@article{Heine2015,
abstract = {Conspectus After the discovery of graphene and the development of powerful exfoliation techniques, experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) crystals can be expected for any layered material that is known to chemistry. Besides graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal chalcogenides (TMC) are among the most studied ultrathin materials. In particular, single-layer MoS2, a direct band gap semiconductor with ∼1.9 eV energy gap, is popular in physics and nanoelectronics, because it nicely complements semimetallic graphene and insulating h-BN monolayer as a construction component for flexible 2D electronics and because it was already successfully applied in the laboratory as basis material for transistors and other electronic and optoelectronic devices. Two-dimensional crystals are subject to significant quantum confinement: compared with their parent layered 3D material, they show different structural, electronic, and optical properties, such as spontaneous rippling as free-standing monolayer, significant changes of the electronic band structure, giant spin-orbit splitting, and enhanced photoluminescence. Most of those properties are intrinsic for the monolayer and already absent for two-layer stacks of the same 2D crystal. For example, single-layer MoS2 is a direct band gap semiconductor with spin-orbit splitting of 150 meV in the valence band, while the bilayer of the same material is an indirect band gap semiconductor without observable spin-orbit splitting. All these properties have been observed experimentally and are in excellent agreement with calculations based on density-functional theory. This Account reports theoretical studies of a subgroup of transition metal dichalcogenides with the composition MX2, with M = Mo, or W and X = Se or S, also referred to as "MoWSeS materials". Results on the electronic structure, quantum confinement, spin-orbit coupling, spontaneous monolayer rippling, and change of electronic properties in the presence of an external electric field are reported. While all materials of the MoWSeS family share the same qualitative properties, their individual values can differ strongly, for example, the spin-orbit splitting in WSe2 reaches the value of 428 meV, nearly three times that of MoS2. Further, we discuss the effect of strain on the electronic properties (straintronics). While MoWSeS single layers are very robust against external electric fields, bilayers show a linear reduction of the band gap, even reaching a semiconductor-metal phase transition, and an increase of the spin-orbit splitting from zero to the monolayer value at rather small fields. Strain is yet another possibility to control the band gap in a linear way, and MoWSeS monolayers become metallic at strain values of ∼10\%. The density-functional based tight-binding model is a useful tool to investigate the electronic and structural properties, including electron conductance, of large MoS2 structures, which show spontaneous rippling in finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Structural defects in MoS2 result in anisotropy of the electric conductivity. Finally, DFT predictions on the properties of noble metal dichalcogenides are presented. Most strikingly, 1T PdS2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor in its monolayer form but becomes metallic as a bilayer.},

abstract = {Layered materials consist of molecular layers stacked together by weak interlayer interactions. They often crystallize to form atomically smooth thin films, nanotubes, and platelet or fullerene-like nanoparticles due to the anisotropic bonding. Structures that predominately expose edges of the layers exhibit high surface energy and are often considered unstable. In this communication, we present a synthesis process to grow MoS2 and MoSe2 thin films with vertically aligned layers, thereby maximally exposing the edges on the film surface. Such edge-terminated films are metastable structures of MoS2 and MoSe2, which may find applications in diverse catalytic reactions. We have confirmed their catalytic activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the exchange current density correlates directly with the density of the exposed edge sites.},

abstract = {The van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of M. Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional "hard" matter such asmetals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for.},

The reader is first introduced to the basic mechanisms of radiation effects in solids with particular emphasis on atom displacements by knock-on collisions. The influence ofvarious parametersonthe displacement cross sections of carbon atoms is discussed. The types of irradiation-induced defects and their migration are described as well as ordering phenomena which are observable under the non-equilibrium conditions of irradiation. The main part of this reviewdeals with alterations of carbon nanostructures by the electron beam in an electron microscope. This type of experiment is of paramount importance because it allows in situ observation of dynamic processes on an atomic scale. In the second part, radiation effects in the modifications of elemental carbon, in particular in graphite which forms the crystallographic basis of most carbon nanostructures, are treated in detail. It follows a review of the available experimental results on radiation defects in carbon nanostructures such as fullerenes, nanotubes and carbon onions. Finally, the phenomena of structure formation under irradiation, in particular the self-assembling of spherical carbon onions and the irradiation- induced transformation of graphitic nanoparticles into diamond, are presented and discussed qualitatively in the context of non-equilibrium structure formation.},

The results are compared with the widely used formula of Seitz and Koehler, based on a low-Z approximation due to McKinley and Feshbach. For low-Z elements, the formula of Seitz and Koehler was found to be accurate. For gold the displacement cross section computed from the Mott series is, in the region of 2-4 MeV bombarding energy, about twice as large as the value obtained from the approximate formula. The behavior of the cross section near threshold and at very high energies has been considered. For high-Z values the displacement cross section shows predominantly a parabolic rise near threshold. At very high energies it falls slowly toward a finite value. The implications of these calculations for various experiments on radiation damage in gold are briefly discussed.},

First, we confirmed that as the number of layers increase, the E', E″ and E2g modes shift to lower frequencies, and the A'1 and A1g modes shift to higher frequencies. Second, new high frequency first order A'1 and A1g modes appear, explaining recently reported experimental data for WSe2, MoSe2 and MoS2. Third, splitting of modes around A'1 and A1g is found which explains those observed in MoSe2. Finally, exterior and interior layers possess different vibrational frequencies.

abstract = {An exact stochastic simulation of the Schroedinger equation for charged bosons and fermions has been used to calculate the correlation energies, to locate the transitions to their respective crystal phases at zero temperature within 10\%, and to establish the stability at intermediate densities of a ferromagnetic fluid of electrons. PACS numbers: 67.90.+i, 71.45.6m The properties of the ground state of the elec-tron gas, also referred to as the fermion one-component plasma and jellium, have rigorously only been established in the limit of high densi-ties' where the system approaches a perfect gas and at low density' where the electrons crystal-lize. Further more, Hartr ee-Fock calculations' and variational calculations4 suggest that at inter-mediate densities, the spin-aligned state of the electrons will be more stable than the normal, unpolarized state. Precise calculations of this many-fermion system are required to establish the regions of stability of the various phases be-cause of the small energy differences among them. This note outlines a Monte Carlo method that, if run long enough on a computer, can give as precise a solution for the ground state of a given fermion system as desired. In practice, the precision of such a calculation is limited to about two orders of magnitude small-er than that of an approximate trial wave func-tion that is introduced as an importance function in the Monte Carlo process. That the introduc-tion of such an importance function is essential was previously demonstrated for the many-boson problem. ' The extension of this boson calcula-tion to fermions requires dealing with antisym-metric functions whose nodes are unknown. This leads to two related complications; namely, the probability density of a random walk cannot be chosen everywhere positive, and unless prevented the random walk will always converge to the all positive, boson ground state. It is demonstrated here that by representing the wave function by the difference between two probability densities, the effect of this inherent instability becomes serious, and it is possible to extract the proper-ties of the lowest antisymmetric state. A more general procedure which removes the effects of the instability has yet to be perfected. The solution of the fermion problem was car-ried out in two steps. In the first step the nodes, the places where the trial function vanishes, act as fixed absorbing barriers to the diffusion proc-ess. Inside a connected nodal region the wave function is everywhere positive and vanishes at the boundaries. With these boundary conditions, the fermion problem is equivalent to a boson problem. The energy calculated with this proce-dure, which we will refer to as the "fixed-node" energy, is an upper bound to the exact fermion ground-state energy and generally very close to it. In principle one could next vary the nodal loca-tions to obtain the best upper bound, for example, by varying the functions used as elements in the Slater determinant of the trial wave function. In practice, the highly dimensional nodal surfaces are difficult to parametrize in a systematic fash-ion. The second step, called "nodal relaxation, " begins with the population of walks from the "fixed-node" approximation. In this second proce-dure, if a random walk strays across the node of the trial function it is not terminated, but the sign of its contribution to any average is re-versed. At any stage of the random walk there is a population of positive walks (those that re-mained in the same nodal region or crossed an even number of nodes) and a population of nega-tive walks (those that crossed an odd number of nodes). The importance function used in this process is the absolute value of the trial function. It can be easily shown that the difference popula-tion converges to the antisymmetric eigenfunc-tion. However, both the positive and negative populations grow geometrically with a rate equal to the difference between the Fermi and Bose en-ergies. If the relaxation time from the fixed-node 566 1980 The American Physical Society VOLUME 45, NUMBER 7 PHYSICAL RKVIKW LETTERS 18 AUGvsr 1980 r E f T where B is the Hamiltonian 2 (2) It is easily verified that for large times, f(r, t) = 4ry, exp[-t(E " f — E,)j, where E, and p, are the exact eigenvalue and eigenfunction. The above equation for f(R, t) has a simple interpretation as a stochastic process. Each member of the en-semble of systems undergoes (i) random diffu-sion caused by the zero-point motion, (ii) bias-ing or drift by the trial quantum force, Vln1@r1', and (iii) branching with probability given by the time step times the difference between the local trial energy, Er=H+r/4r, and the arbitrarily chosen reference energy, E " f. By *'branching", it is meant that a particular system is either eliminated from the ensemble (if the local energy is greater than the reference energy) or dupli-cated in the ensemble (otherwise). A steady-state population of the ensemble requires that the reference energy equal the lowest eigenvalue. This is one way of determining the eigenvalue. The trial wave function employed in the present calculations is identical with those used in an earlier Monte Carlo variational calculation. This trial function is a product of two-body cor-relation factors times a Slater determinant of single-particle orbitals. The two-body correla-tion factors are chosen such that they remove distribution times this energy difference is less than unity, the fermion energy can be reliably extracted. We have found that for the electron gas this condition is satisfied if the nodes of the Hartree-Fock wave function are used. our simulation method is a simpler version of the Green's function Monte Carlo method of Kalos, Levesque, and Verlet.

We also observe that the negative pressure which needs to be applied to crystalline compound can be reliably interpolated by taking the concentration-weighted average of the pressures determined from purl crystals made of each of the elements present in the compound. In a large class of materials, the knowledge of one pressure per element is thus sufficient to correct most of the bias in lattice constants and elastic properties. We finally propose a simple model of the nonlocal contribution to the exchange-correlations energy that is able to explain the observed linear dependence between the required negative pressure and concentration.

abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of -';.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic lelds are also treated by similar methods.

Single vacancies are found to be mobile under the electron beam and tend to agglomerate into lines. Different kinds of such extended defects are identified in the experiments, and their atomic structures and electronic properties are determined with the help of calculations. The orientation of line defects is found to be sensitive to mechanical strain. Our calculations also indicate that the electronic properties of the extended defects can be tuned by filling vacancy lines with other atomic species, thereby suggesting a way for strain and electron-beam-assisted engineering of MoS2-based nanostructures .},

We directly measure the atomic displacement ("knock-on") cross section by counting the lost atoms as a function of the electron beam energy and applied dose. Further, we separate knock-on damage (originating from the collision of the beam electrons with the nucleus of the target atom) from other radiation damage mechanisms (e.g. ionization damage or chemical etching) by the comparison of ordinary (12C) and heavy (13C) graphene. Our analysis shows that a static lattice approximation is not sufficient to describe knock-on damage in this material, while a very good agreement between calculated and experimental cross sections is obtained if lattice vibrations are taken into account.},

Each heterostructure configuration possesses a unique Raman spectrum in both frequency and intensity that can be explained by changes in dielectric screening and interlayer interaction.

For a representative structure of MoS2, we carry out high-resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments and validate our theoretical predictions via observations of vacancy formation under exposure to an 80 keV electron beam. We further show that TMDs can be doped by filling the vacancies created by the electron beam with impurity atoms. Thereby, our results not only shed light on the radiation response of a system with reduced dimensionality, but also suggest new ways for engineering the electronic structure of TMDs.},

abstract = {The atomic and electronic structures and stability of native defects in a single-layer MoS2 are investigated, based on density-functional theory calculations. Native defects such as a S vacancy (V-S), a S interstitial (S-i), a Mo vacancy (V-Mo), and a Mo interstitial (Mo-i) are considered. The S-i is found to have S-adatom configuration on top of a host S atom, and the Mo-i has Mo-Mo-i split interstitial configuration along the c direction. The formation energies of the native defects in neutral and charged states are calculated. For the charged states, the artificial electrostatic interactions between image charges in supercells are eliminated by a supercell size scaling scheme and a correction scheme that uses a Gaussian model charge. It is found that the V-S has a low formation energy of 1.3-1.5 eV in the Mo-rich limit condition, and the S-i has 1.0 eV in the S-rich limit condition. The V-S is found to be a deep single acceptor with the (0/-) transition level at 1.7 eV above the valence-band maximum (VBM). The S-i is found to be an electrically neutral defect. The Mo-related native defects of V-Mo and Mo-i are found to be high in formation energy above 4 eV. The V-Mo is a deep single acceptor and the Mo-i is a deep single donor, of which the (0/-) acceptor and (+/0) donor transition levels are found at 1.1 and 0.3 eV above the VBM, respectively.},

abstract = {As defects frequently govern the properties of crystalline solids, the precise microscopic knowledge of defect atomic structure is of fundamental importance. We report a new class of point defects in single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides that can be created through 60° rotations of metal-chalcogen bonds in the trigonal prismatic lattice, with the simplest among them being a three-fold symmetric trefoil-like defect. The defects, which are inherently related to the crystal symmetry of transition metal dichalcogenides, can expand through sequential bond rotations, as evident from in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments, and eventually form larger linear defects consisting of aligned 8-5-5-8 membered rings. First-principles calculations provide insights into the evolution of rotational defects and show that they give rise to p-type doping and local magnetic moments, but weakly affect mechanical characteristics of transition metal dichalcogenides. Thus, controllable introduction of rotational defects can be used to engineer the properties of these materials.},

We consider single-and few-atom vacancies, antisites, adatoms on monolayer, and interstitials between layers in the bulk material. We calculate the formation energies of neutral and charged defects, determine the charge transition levels, and from these self-consistently assess the concentration of defects at thermal equilibrium as well as the resulting positions of the Fermi level. The chemical potential values corresponding to different growth conditions are carefully accounted for, and for all values of chemical potentials relevant to the growth of MoS2, the S vacancies are found to be the most abundant defects. However, they are acceptors and cannot be the cause of the often observed n-type doping. At the same time, Re impurities, which are often present in natural MoS2 samples, naturally provide good n-type doping behavior. We also calculate migration barriers for adatoms and interstitials and discuss how they can affect the growth process.},
